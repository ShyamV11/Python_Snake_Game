# Python_Snake_Game

A simple terminal played snake game that uses the RANDOM and CURSES Packages.


CURSES Package might not work the best with WINDOWS OS.

Python for Windows doesn't come with curses. You need to visit http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses, download the version of curses that corresponds to your Windows and version of Python, and then pip install the whl file with the python you plan on using.

pip uninstall curses-menu and pip install curses-menu should work for most part. Else try pip install windows-curses.

Ref: more about CURSES on https://docs.python.org/2/howto/curses.html
